# Optimize Repo

Cross-harness source of truth for cleaning up this repo's customization files after agents produce verbose, duplicated,
or drifted instructions. Use this as the audit path in report-only mode and as the cleanup playbook in apply-fixes mode.

## When to Use

- Clean up or audit instruction files, skills, or agents.
- Re-verify any repo `*.md` for verbosity, repetition, padded explanation.
- Targets: redundancy, stale routing, harness drift, source-of-truth violations.
- Restore the current repo structure after cheaper or less careful models copy long rules into the wrong files.

## Current Structure

| Surface | Owner / Shape |
|---------|---------------|
| Repo workflow, command contract, bootstrap, command table | `CLAUDE.md`; keep compact and table-first. |
| Copilot entrypoint | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; thin pointer to `CLAUDE.md` and Copilot wrappers. |
| Claude entrypoint | `CLAUDE.md`; main instruction file — all shared rules live here. |
| Shared skills | `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; owns actual procedure. |
| Copilot skill wrappers | `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; frontmatter plus one pointer line. |
| Claude skill wrappers | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; frontmatter plus one pointer line. |
| Shared agent behavior | `.agents/agents/<name>.md`; role, routing, and repo-specific behavior. |
| Copilot agent wrappers | `.github/agents/<name>.agent.md`; harness metadata plus pointer. |
| Claude agent wrappers | `.claude/agents/<name>.md`; harness metadata plus pointer. |
| Agent/skill resource dirs | `.agents/agents/rules/` or `.agents/skills/<name>/`; on-demand reference files for oversized instruction files (see 500-line rule). |
| Human onboarding | `README.md`; install/bootstrap/command examples, not policy detail. |

## Reference Ownership

Skills and docs must point to these owner files instead of restating their rules.

| Domain | Owner |
|--------|-------|
| Archive layout, naming, frontmatter, required tools | `CLAUDE.md` (Medical DB section) |
| Command invocation contract (`uv run ...` only) | `CLAUDE.md` (Shared section) |
| Bootstrap after fresh checkout | `CLAUDE.md` (Medical DB section) |
| Canonical markdown lint command (`uv run lint-md`) | `CLAUDE.md` (Shared section) |
| Markdown lint config | `.pymarkdown.yaml` |
| Evidence hierarchy, quality standards, search protocol | `.agents/agents/med-researcher.md` |
| Harms/safety search, counter-evidence requirements | `.agents/agents/med-researcher.md` |
| Research output format | `.agents/agents/med-researcher.md` |
| Shared Python utilities | `.agents/scripts/utils.py` |

## Procedure

1. Mode: review-only (report) or cleanup (smallest edits that restore ownership and cut repetition). If the user asked
   for a plan only, do not edit.
2. Respect repo ignore boundaries before any audit or edit:
   - Treat all files and folders excluded by `.gitignore` as out of scope for this skill.
   - Do not read, audit, edit, move, delete, or regenerate ignored paths.
   - If a requested cleanup would require touching an ignored path, stop and report that it is intentionally excluded.
3. Capture the current state before editing:
   - Check `git status --short`.
   - Count relevant instruction lines with `wc -l CLAUDE.md README.md .agents/skills/*/SKILL.md
   .github/skills/*/SKILL.md .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md .agents/agents/*.md .github/agents/* .claude/agents/*`.
   - Flag any instruction file over ~500 lines for splitting (see 500-line rule in audit step 4).
   - Read changed files before patching; assume user/formatter edits are intentional unless they break the task.
4. Audit against the structure above:
   - `CLAUDE.md` should ideally stay under 80 lines but must never exceed 150 lines and keep command reference as a table.
   - Wrapper files should stay about 10 lines: frontmatter, heading, pointer.
   - Shared skills should contain input parsing, delegated calls, procedure, validation, and output only.
   - Agent files should be one focused role; evidence and safety rules stay in the shared agent file.
   - **500-line rule:** Any instruction file over ~500 lines must be split into a slim core file (~200–500 lines
     of always-needed content) plus a `rules/` subdirectory holding self-contained reference files. Each
     resource file gets minimal YAML frontmatter (`description`) and is read on-demand via explicit "Read
     `<path>` when `<condition>`" instructions in the core file. Resource files hold: domain-specific
     knowledge, output templates, bootstrap/setup procedures — anything not needed every invocation.
   - `README.md` should explain onboarding and use tables for command examples; avoid becoming a second policy surface.
5. Repair messy instructions in this order:
   - Restore source-of-truth ownership first; move or delete restated policy before wordsmithing.
   - Replace copied rules with short pointers such as `Follow CLAUDE.md (Medical DB section).` or `Follow
   .agents/agents/med-researcher.md.`
   - Delete padded explanation when a command, table row, or owner-doc pointer carries the meaning.
   - Convert command lists to tables when agents need to scan operation → command quickly.
   - Keep command examples in `CLAUDE.md` and README synchronized in spirit, but do not duplicate every policy note.
   - **Split oversized files (>~500 lines):** Identify self-contained sections that aren't needed every invocation
     (domain-specific knowledge, output templates, bootstrap/setup procedures). Extract each to a resource file in a
     `rules/` subdirectory with YAML frontmatter (`description`). Replace with an explicit "Read `<path>` when
     `<condition>`" instruction. Keep core identity, safety rules, writing rules, and always-needed procedures inline.
     Follow the pattern in `.agents/agents/psychotherapist.md` + `.agents/agents/rules/`.
6. Keep discovery-critical frontmatter concise:
   - Skill descriptions should identify when to invoke the skill, not explain policy.
   - Argument hints should show input shape only.
   - If a wrapper needs policy text to be correct, the shared skill or reference owner is probably missing a pointer.
7. Re-check after edits:
   - Names, descriptions, and argument hints aligned across `.agents`, `.github`, and `.claude` surfaces.
   - Wrapper bodies still point at the right shared file.
   - Paired agents differ only where the harness requires different metadata/tools.
   - Repo docs advertise only surfaces worth exposing.

## Redundancy Patterns

After cleanup, grep for these patterns in all repo `*.md` files (excluding wrappers and this audit list). Remaining
matches must only appear in the listed owner files.

`uv run med-db`, `uv run med-db-validate`, `uv run med-db-lookup`, `uv run med-db-query`, `uv run test`, `uv run
lint-md`
→ `CLAUDE.md` only (README may show examples).

`searches/`, `papers/`, `fulltext/`, `guidelines/`, `web/`, `metadata.json`, `abstract.txt`, `source.md`, `YAML
frontmatter`, `bootstrap`, `gitignored`
→ `CLAUDE.md` only.

Evidence hierarchy, quality criteria, counter-evidence, harms/safety, Research Output Format
→ `.agents/agents/med-researcher.md` only.

`Sci-Hub`
→ `CLAUDE.md` and `.agents/agents/med-researcher.md` only. Do not duplicate elsewhere.

`DocCheck Flexicon`
→ `.agents/agents/med-researcher.md` only.

`.pymarkdown.yaml`
→ Config file. `CLAUDE.md` may reference the lint command.

## Preferred Shapes

- Use tables for command matrices, routing maps, source-of-truth maps, source priority, and platform/mirror status.
- Use bullets for short behavior rules and validation checks.
- Do not nest bullets deeper than one level unless the existing file already requires it for readability.
- Avoid long prose in wrappers and entrypoints; `CLAUDE.md` is the main instruction file and may be longer.
- Preserve non-ASCII already used for German terms, arrows, and source names; do not add decorative symbols.

## Writing Rules

- Match the repo's direct procedural tone.
- Never sacrifice meaning or expressiveness for shorter prose.
- Strict source-of-truth ownership.
- Anything excluded by `.gitignore` is out of scope and must remain untouched.
- Skill wrappers and agent wrappers stay short unless a harness difference requires more.
- Preserve keyword-rich frontmatter for discovery.
- Prefer brevity and clarity over grammatical smoothness in every repo `*.md`.
- Drop repetitive phrasing and padding when the meaning carries tighter.
- Don't replace duplication with a new documentation layer.

## Validation

1. Run Markdown/frontmatter diagnostics on every changed file.
2. Run `git diff --check`.
3. Confirm no file or folder excluded by `.gitignore` was touched.
4. Re-run the redundancy-pattern grep and account for every remaining match.
5. Compare paired skill wrappers: `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` should match
except for deliberate harness differences.
6. Re-read changed `*.md` for padding, repeated phrases, stale owner references, and accidental second sources of truth.
7. Confirm `CLAUDE.md` is compact and command tables remain tables.
8. After completing edits to any `*.md` file, run `uv run lint-md`.
9. If any `*.py` file changed, run `uv run test`.

## Output

- Files optimized.
- Files audited, unchanged.
- Validation performed, including `uv run lint-md` for Markdown edits and whether `uv run test` was needed.
- Remaining inconsistencies left intentionally, with reason.
